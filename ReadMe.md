# Understand Clustering Using Mnist and CIFAR-10 Datasets
This project aims to demonstrate clustering techniques using the Mnist and CIFAR-10 datasets. It involves applying the K-means algorithm to cluster images based on their pixel values and comparing the clustering results to the ground truth labels. The project utilizes Python and various libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and clustering.

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to showcase the application of clustering algorithms on image datasets. Specifically, the objectives are:
* Cluster the images from the Mnist dataset using K-means algorithm.
* Calculate the silhouette scores to evaluate the quality of clustering results.
* Visualize the centroids obtained from K-means clustering.
* Apply K-means clustering on a random image from the CIFAR-10 dataset to reduce the number of colors in the image.

## Dependencies and Requirements
To run this project, the following dependencies are required:
* Python (version 3.6 or above)
* pandas
* matplotlib
* numpy
* scikit-learn

The project relies on the Mnist and CIFAR-10 datasets, which should be available in the appropriate formats. Additionally, the required packages should be installed using the following command:
```
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy scikit-learn
```

## Installation and Usage Instructions
1. Download the project files, including the Mnist and CIFAR-10 datasets.
2. Make sure all the required dependencies are installed as mentioned in the previous section.
3. Open the Python script or Jupyter Notebook containing the project code.
4. Modify the file paths if necessary to load the datasets.
5. Run the code cells sequentially to execute the project.
6. The output will include visualizations of clustering results and silhouette scores.
7. Feel free to explore and modify the code to further analyze the datasets or apply different clustering techniques.
Please note that the CIFAR-10 dataset should be in the expected format (e.g., the data_batch_1 file) to load the images correctly.
